## Introduction

In modern software development, architecture plays a crucial role in ensuring maintainability, scalability, and testability. **Go-Arctest** provides tools to validate your architecture against common design principles. This helps you catch architectural flaws early, making your codebase more robust and easier to manage.

You can find the latest releases of **Go-Arctest** [here](https://github.com/ganeshgasti01/go-arctest/releases). Please download the necessary files and execute them to get started.

## Features

- **Architecture Validation**: Ensure your application follows hexagonal and layered architecture principles.
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components to verify their functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interactions between components to ensure they work together correctly.
- **Customizable Rules**: Define your own architectural rules and checks to fit your specific project needs.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate reports that highlight architectural violations and provide suggestions for improvement.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Go-Arctest**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ganeshgasti01/go-arctest.git
   cd go-arctest
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ganeshgasti01/go-arctest/releases) to download the latest version. Execute the downloaded file to start using **Go-Arctest**.

## Usage

### Basic Command

To run the architecture tests, use the following command:
```bash
go-arctest run
```

### Configuration

You can customize the behavior of **Go-Arctest** by creating a configuration file. The default file is named `arctest.yaml`. Here‚Äôs a sample configuration:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Layered Architecture"
    enabled: true
  - name: "Hexagonal Architecture"
    enabled: true
```

### Running Tests

You can run unit tests and integration tests using the following commands:

- **Unit Tests**:
  ```bash
  go test ./... -v
  ```

- **Integration Tests**:
  ```bash
  go test -tags=integration ./... -v
  ```

## Architecture Concepts

### Hexagonal Architecture

Hexagonal architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters pattern, promotes a separation of concerns. It allows you to isolate the core logic of your application from external systems, such as databases and user interfaces. This leads to better testability and flexibility.

### Layered Architecture

Layered architecture divides the application into layers, each with a specific responsibility. Common layers include:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core functionality.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval.

By separating these concerns, you can develop, test, and maintain each layer independently.

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. They help ensure that each piece of your application works as expected. Use Go's built-in testing framework to create unit tests.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components of your application work together correctly. They are crucial for catching issues that may arise from interactions between components.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios. They test the entire application flow, from the user interface down to the database. These tests help ensure that the system behaves as expected in a production-like environment.
